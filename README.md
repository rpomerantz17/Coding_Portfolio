# Coding_Portfolio

This is my coding portfolio for employers.  TokenPair_Price_Retriever and Get_Bitcoin_Price were done with python,
alarm_clock and calculator were done with html, css, and javascript.

Demo_Shop was done with React.js, and the following files were not added: node_modules folder,
index.html, package-lock.json, package.json, vite.configure.js.  In the src folder you can find
the jsx code that I created along with the components.
